I'm a third year undergraduate student from School of PHY, Peking University, currently enrolled in the 22nd Turing Class. At the same time, I studied for a double degree in economics at the National School of Development.

My research interests and skills are concentrated in the fields of ml, nlp, llms, etc. I am currently studying in Mr. Yizhou Wang's program.

The website is still under construction. Codes and course notes are uploading quickly.
